### Hey, I'm Heather! Nice to meet you 😊
I use she/her pronouns!

I value work that uplifts those in my community in an authentic and effective way. I look forward to combining my technical knowledge, problem solving skills, and leadership skills with my passion for music, education, and accessibility to level the playing field for whoever I can.
